# AN-MS-Fittings

This is a repository of CAD files for AN/AS and MS fittings. There are Autodesk Inventor specific iParts in the root of the directory that can be placed into assemblies. There are also folders for each type of fitting that contains models for each size of the fitting, in both .ipt for Inventor and .stl.

 I am trying to make this a relatively comprehensive library, and will continue adding parts.
 This library only goes up to the -32 size (2" Tube size). I have no need for anything nearly that large, so I have omitted the sizes larger than that to save time.

 Also, I have copied the dimensions right from the specification for the fittings, so I think they are accurate. However, I would recommend using this library for reference only. I cannot guarantee that all of the fittings are correct. Feel free to submit an issue to request additional AN/AS/MS fittings. Enjoy!
